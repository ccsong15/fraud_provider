Fraud costs the U.S. about $60 billion annually and accounts for up to 10 percent of total healthcare spending. If we are able to identify which providers are more likely to have fraud behavior, we can prevent the financial loss and protect the healthcare system so that they can provide quality and safe care to patients."
